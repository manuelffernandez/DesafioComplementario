*24 of August 2022*

The first assigment requested by the Institute where IÂ´m currently learning. Do a simple algorithm implementing the basics of the lenguage:
* Declare, redeclare and initialize variables.
* Use conditionals and loops.
* Inputs by `prompt()`.


### :repeat: This app does a simple task: repeat words :repeat:
It asks the user through `prompt()` the word and the times he wants to repeat it. The result shows in console.

First step, a little but an important one. :muscle:
